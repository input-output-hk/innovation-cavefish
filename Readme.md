<h3 align="center">Communication-Optimal Light Client Protocol for UTxO Ledgers</h3>

Cavefish is a **light client protocol** for UTxO-based blockchains like Cardano and Bitcoin.  
It enables resource-constrained clients to construct and submit transactions **without downloading or parsing the full ledger**,  
using a simple two-party protocol between a **Light Client (LC)** and a **Service Provider (SP)**.

## What’s in this repository?

This repository hosts the **LaTeX sources of the Cavefish paper**, which describes the protocol in detail.  

- 📂 [`paper/`](./paper/) — LaTeX sources and a Makefile to build the paper.  
- 📂 [`publication/`](./publication/) — timestamped PDF builds of the paper.  


## How to Build

If you’d like to compile the paper yourself, please see the [README inside `paper/`](./paper/README.md).  
It contains full build instructions and explains the folder layout.
