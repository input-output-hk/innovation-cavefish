\begin{abstract}
Blockchain light clients (LCs) are platform users that do not have the capacity to locally maintain current, 
fully-validated ledger state. For this reason, light clients rely on service providers (SPs, which 
are full nodes) for obtaining the 
blockchain data they require, e.g. for transaction construction or running off-chain apps. 
This work focuses on a model in which a light client of a UTxO-style platform has the goal of submitting a 
transaction with minimal local state and minimal local processing. We propose a 2-party computation 
protocol between the LC and the SP. First, the light client creates a specification for the transaction 
they would like the SP to construct, then the SP builds such a transaction, including in it a payment to themselves. 
The SP sends the LC a modified version of this transaction for signing and checking. It is modified in a way 
that makes it impossible for the LC to use the data in this transaction to construct a distinct new (valid) 
transaction without guessing pre-images of transaction hashes, but has enough information to allow the LC to 
check that it meets their specification. Using a secure partially-blind 
signature scheme, the SP is able to obtain a signature on the original (unmodified) transaction, 
which is then submitted to the network for inclusion in a block. This 2-PC protocol constitutes a trustless 
interaction between the LC and the SP resulting in the LC's desired transaction being applied 
to the ledger state, and the SP receiving payment for their work.

\section{Introduction}
\todobox{
What sets us apart?

\begin{itemize}
    \item Atomicity of payment+service
    
    \item permission-less, decentralized

    \item Model for (trustless) 2-party transaction construction rather than proving things about chain/ledger state

    \item Do not require establishing a relationship with SP or any other set-up
    
    \item inherent timeliness of transaction construction incentivized by SPs desired to earn 
    their tip. This is in contrast with the possibility of stale info provided from old Mithril snapshots in other LC models
\end{itemize}}

The core of our design is an answer to the question of "how can a user request and approve payment (e.g. from their wallet) without knowing anything about the chain except what the transaction spending their money is doing with their money"?

We claim that our work can be used by any UTxO or EUTxO blockchain (with some adjustments to the details of intent specification). 
We use blind signatures \cite{blindsigs}

\section{Related Work}


Our approach provides facilitates transaction submission for a light client that is not aware of the entire history of a blockchain. 
Therefore, we compare our work with existing solutions for light clients as well as mechanisms that allow the interaction with a blockchain when in resource constrained operation.
Our approach is different from a more ``traditional'' (i.e., what commonly is referred to) light client that has the primary goal of syncing to the blockchain in order to acquire the information necessary to interact with a smart contract or to submit a transaction. 
We summarize the most important concepts and works in the area of light clients below.

We first describe the common idea of a light client and then outline concepts related to our work that complement light clients. 

A summary of \textbf{light client research} can be found in~\cite{soklc}, listing the main functionalities a light client is expected to perform: (1) issue queries, such as for the balance of an account, or the state of a transaction, and (2) safeguard secrecy information and submit transactions to the blockchain.
In order to implement these functionalities, light clients use several generic techniques, most notably: header verification and consensus evolution verification. Compared to a \emph{full node} a light client only verifies the headers of blocks and skips the verification of transactions and account balances, a technique made popular with SPV in Bitcoin~\cite{spv} and nearly adopted by most practical approaches for light clients, e.g.,~\cite{Ethereumlc}.
In addition to that, consensus evolution verification is needed for proof-of-stake based blockchains as the validator set can change. 
Another common technique is to compress blockchain and/or ledger state to reduce the information a light client has to download to verify proofs and synchronize to the blockchain (see, e.g.,~\cite{flyclient}).
Some light clients use game-theoretic assumptions to implement the slashing of previously deposited collateral in case of misbehavior, for example~\cite{superlight}.
The main cryptographic building blocks that are used to realize those techniques are succinct representation and proofs, such as data accumulators (often Merkle trees) and commitments and SNARKs.
Furthermore, suitable signatures and hash functions are needed, for example, aggregate signatures and threshold signatures. 

Most related works and ideas are \textbf{intents} and \textbf{solver networks} that attempt to establish a relationship between solvers and users via their (light) clients~\cite{ethresearch-solvers}.
A light client issues an intent via as an abstracted transaction object and solvers process the intent incentivized by transaction fee or intent execution reward. The users are then free to accept or reject a solver’s proposal.
Outsourcing transaction creation to a solver does not need for user to bridge assets cross-chain, as chains are abstracted away. In case the solvers are required to provide a deposit, slashing guarantees honest behavior of a rational actor.
While concepts around solver networks are relatively new there is currently no universal standard governing the specification for intents and abstract transaction objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work describing 

\textbf{Payment channels}. 
We also briefly cover \textbf{payment channels} (also called \textbf{state channels}), which also constitute 
a concept similar to our approach: 
payment channels describe a type of off-chain mechanism for blockchains. They allow to establish a private payment 
channel between two parties. The channel can be used to conduct a series of (similar) transactions without interacting 
with the main blockchain. The creation of a payment channel requires locking funds in a smart contract, which is used 
to conduct the transactions~\cite{payment-channel}. Some state channels, such as Hydra \cite{hydra}, not only allow 
for simple payments between users, but simulate the majority of the on-chain transaction processing mechanism internally. 

Participation in a payment channel usually presumes that a user is able to predict, to some degree, the nature of the 
anticipated payments they will send or receive, and accepts that interactions within the channel will be limited 
to users, contracts, and tokens, available in that channel (i.e. locked by the channel's smart contract).
Due to the specifics of the channel setup process, and the limited nature of these interactions, payment channels 
are capable of greatly improving scalability 
and reducing transaction processing times. The target user base for our light client design, however, are ones 
that do not wish to engage in establishing relationships with other chain users, or participating 
in an on-chain setup process. They also may not have (or choose 
not to disclose) information about intended future interactions. For these reasons, it does not make sense to limit themselves 
to a specific payment channel. 

\textbf{API and Explorer Services}. 
Many realistic UTxO ledger implementations (e.g. Ergo \footnote{\url{https://ergoplatform.org/}}, 
Cardano \footnote{\url{https://cardano.org/}}, and BitCoin \footnote{\url{https://bitcoin.org/}}) are set up 
in a way that a badly constructed transaction will, in many cases, not result in any update to the ledger 
state. So, even if a transaction is constructed by an LC based on ledger or block data that is incorrect or 
old, the worst-case scenario is that it will be rejected. This makes 
services such as blockchain explorers \footnote{\url{https://beta.explorer.cardano.org/}} or Blockfrost (API 
as a service for accessing the Cardano blockchain) \footnote{\url{https://blockfrost.dev/}} are some of the 
strongest competitors with our proposal, as they provide the data needed 
for the LC to construct their transaction, often with a relatively high degree of reliability. 
With this in mind, what sets our design apart is the SP compensation structure. Revenue from services such as those above is 
either ad-based, requires users to create an account paid for with fiat currency, or is free in order to 
promote use of the specific service/blockchain. We, on the other hand, propose that SPs are compensated 
in assets on the same blockchain as the one to which their transaction gets applied, and the payment structure 
consists of a one-time, no-setup atomic exchange of assets for services.

\subsection{Technical Background}
UTxO model

\input{model.tex}


\section{Light Client Specification}
 
 We will model light clients in terms of their functionality, restrictions and protocols for communication with full nodes. By functionality, we refer to the interaction between a light client and its user(s). To satisfy user requests a light client will need to connect to and query a number of full nodes via a set of protocols prescribed by its design.
 
 
 We describe functionality of a light client in terms of reading and posting \emph{intents} denoted as two sets of predicates $\mathcal{I}_\mathsf{read}$, $\mathcal{I}_\mathsf{post}$. When queried on a reading predicate $\mathsf{int_{read}} \in \mathcal{I}_\mathsf{read}$ at time $t_0$, the light client replies with all transactions $tx$ such that $\mathsf{int_{read}}(tx,\LState_t)=1$, where  $\LState_t$ is the state of the blockchain at time $t \geq t_0$. When queried on a posting predicate $\mathsf{int_{post}} \in \mathcal{I}_\mathsf{post}$ at time $t_0$, the light client prepares a transaction $tx_p$ such that $\mathsf{int_{post}}(tx_p,\LState_t)=1$, where $t \geq t_0$ and broadcasts it to the blockchain.
 
\todobox{ [TODO: revisit time]
 [TODO: can we do the LC part of bridges with these intents?]}
 
 In order to provide answers to queries by the user, a light client participates in a number of protocols between itself and a set of full nodes. These protocols may be one to one or one to many, depending on the design of the light client. We will expand on the syntax and operation of such protocols in the following subsection.
 
 Lastly, a light client is characterized in terms of restrictions placed on the resources it has available (without restrictions, we could treat a a full node of a chain as a light client). These restrictions can relate to the  communication cost to answer a series of queries, available storage, and assumptions about connectivity. On the other side, a particular light client design might limit the intents contained in $\mathcal{I}_\mathsf{read}$, $\mathcal{I}_\mathsf{post}$ to simplify its design.


 \subsection{Intent Specification}
Intent (DSL or predicate to describe intent of the client, ie what they want to do to the ledger state).

\todobox{Give example of :

\begin{itemize}
    \item intent to mint some tokens before a deadline
    \item intent to pay x from key k1 to k2 (ie script $\fun{RequireSig}~k1$ to $\fun{RequireSig}~k2$)
\end{itemize}}
 
 \subsection{Light Client Interactions}
 
The light client interacts with a number of full nodes. We assume that all parties know the current time up to an allowable deviation $\delta_t$. We allow for protocols featuring a single or multiple full nodes, and (orthogonally) protocols that are supported by a smart contract at the cost of additional setup. An important difference between the single and multi-node model is that existential honesty trivialises the single-node case. As such, single-node protocols are usually required to operate under more stringent security assumptions.
 
The end result of such protocols are typically one of the following: an update to the light client's state or the creation of a transaction to be posted on the blockchain.  In  Section \ref{sec:threats} we give an informal treatment of potential threats and in Section \ref{sec:protocols} we describe a number of such protocols and formalize the corresponding security notions.
 
\todobox{
 \begin{itemize}
 
\item User - LC interface
 
 \item LC characteristics/ limitations
   \begin{itemize}
\item What are the capabilities of a light client?

\item Does it remember all addresses it has been paid at (tx history)?

\item Do we assume that viewing keys exist? Can we assume LC can generate first x addresses from its private key in a
deterministic way? 

\item Is light client allowed to maintain state, and what state can they maintain if so? Secret key is the minimum state.
\item Sanity test: if we dismiss all requirements we should recover a full client.
\end{itemize}

 \item LC - Full Node interactions
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Protocols to support user requests
  \item Security reqs (protecting integrity/ privacy/ SPO revenue?)
\end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}}
 
 \textbf{Optimization Function}. We assume that all specification-meeting 
 transactions are acceptable to the LC. However, the LC may have a preferred optimization function 
 $\fun{opt} : \TxData \to \Z$  which they (optionally) send alongside their request 
 to the SP, such that a transaction $\var{tx}$ is \emph{optimal} in a set $S \in \type{Set}~\TxData$ when 
 
 \[ \fun{opt}~\var{tx} = \fun{min}~\{~\fun{opt}~\var{tx'}~\|~\var{tx'}~\in~S~\} \]
 
 For example, an optimal transaction may be one that minimizes the total amount of primary tokens 
 spent by the transaction, i.e. $\fun{opt}~\var{tx} = \fun{coinValue}~(\sum_{o \in~\var{txd}.\fun{spentOuts}} \var{o}.\val)$.
 This optimization function cannot be part of the specification, since a proof of optimality is not 
 required.  The kind of 
 sophisticated optimization (such as what is required, e.g., for order-matching) is not a well-suited 
 task for an LC to outsource to an SP, and would require an entirely distinct set of tools for 
 demonstrating the optimality result. For example, such tools may include zero-knowledge proofs 
 that there are no better offers for a specific token available on the ledger. We do not assume that 
 either the SP or the LC are necessarily capable of performing or verifying (resp.) optimality according to the 
 function LC requested be optimized. One of the major obstacles to this is the difficulty of demonstrating that 
 the response is optimal in a non-stale ledger state (see Section \ref{sec:stale-state}).

\todobox{Can we describe the differences between light wallets, bridges and light nodes in our framework? (Probably yes). 

How can we formalize the intent of a light client without revealing secret key?

Can we have viewing keys?}


\section{Threat Model and Threat Mitigation}
\label{sec:threats}

\textbf{Erroneous User Balance.} A common threat vector is convincing the user of an erroneous balance on their account. This can lead a user to
complete a transaction outside the blockchain based on wrong information (e.g. accept an invalid transaction as payment for goods, or exchange his private key
in the understanding that is controls $x$ stake instead of $y$.)

\textbf{Invalid Transactions.}  In response to an LC query, it may be desirable for an SP to construct a transaction that does not meet the intent specified by the user. For example, the created transaction may pay the wrong recipient, or pay an amount over and above the one specified by the user.   

\textbf{Protocol Failures.}  In a multi-node protocol, a malicious user may wish to force the protocol to abort even though there exist a number of honest nodes who would otherwise ensure the protocol completes successfully. In the single node, a malicious node can always cause a protocol to fail by not replying.

\textbf{Suboptimal Transactions.}  In response to an LC query, it is possible for an SP to construct a 
\emph{sub-optimal} transaction which nevertheless matches the LC's specification. For example, the LC may 
include a larger-than-necessary system fee in the transaction, or not provide the LC with the best 
available exchange price for a specific token.
Our model assumes that an LC is able to submit their transaction to multiple SPs, and will have pick one 
transaction to sign from the resulting set $S$ of responses received within some pre-defined amount of 
waiting time. Alternatively, the LC may simply choose the first valid transaction sent by an SP.
Assuming such a competitive SP environment, the suboptimal transaction threat is mitigated by 
the incentive, in the form of a service fee for the SP, to provide both quickest and the most optimal 
response. Note that the SP is not a-priori aware of how the LC will make 
the choice of what transaction to sign, and how long their waiting period is.

\textbf{Response Delays and Stale State.}
\label{sec:stale-state}

Arbitrary delay caused by SP: SP can offer to execute an intent and provide the crafted TX, but never publish it on the chain.
    For this reason, SP should provide the hashes of the UTxO references (or similar) to the light client, s.t. the LC can reuse those references in another transaction. This avoids the case where SP hangs on to the TX indefinitely or posts it at an arbitrary point in time causing two or more TXs being executed if the LC resubmits its intent/TX.

\textbf{Non-submission of Transactions.} A class of protocols deals with the joint creation of transactions by the light client and node, with the transaction submission being left to the full node. It is possible for the full node to not post such a transaction in a timely manner, potentially leading the user to retry at a different time. As intents are not necessarily satisfied by a unique transaction, it is possible that the first full node may be able to post the first transaction (which is purposefully delayed) after the posting of the second one. This can cause the user to e.g. double pay for a service as well as the full node fee.

\textbf{Falsified or Unsafe Transaction Data}. SP lies to client about the UTxOs being spent by the tx, and tricks them into doing something they didn’t want to do (that’s why 0-knowledge proof that outputs were correctly specified)

\textbf{Data Leakage.} The 2-PC protocol we propose is one that has leakage. In particular, 
the co-construction of a transaction by the LC and the SP allows the LC to learn certain information 
about the chain state, such as, e.g. the upper and lower bound of the interval containing the current blockchain 
time. In fact, under certain circumstances, after several iterations of our SP-LC protocol, the LC 
may gain the capacity to construct certain kinds of transactions themselves. As noted above, this 
information can also be gained from blockchain explorer services. The 
reason an LC may engage in our protocol that it allows all transaction-construction,
and state-tracking and querying logic to be off-loaded to the SP. If the LC can do all this themselves, 
engaging in the protocol does not benefit them in any way. 

However, there is a specific kind of 
data leakage threat we have have built the protocol to be resilient against : leakage of $\UTxO$ entry 
identifiers, i.e. the inputs of a transaction. It is impossible to construct a valid transaction 
without knowing the the inputs that need to be included in it for it to match the specification,
and this information cannot be guessed without knowledge of blockchain state. If this information 
is somehow leaked to the LC along with the modified transaction, it makes it possible to for the 
LC to not pay the SP for their work.  

Specifically, the full transaction (including the correct inputs) can be modified locally to 
replace the output containing the SP's fee with one returning it as change to the LC, signed, and 
submitted to the network by the LC. As part of our protocol, the SP replaces the inputs of a 
transaction with outputs that correspond to those inputs in the UTxO set. 
We have demonstrated that guessing inputs without access to either the inputs themselves, or 
the transactions that have placed them into the UTxO set, is sufficiently difficult to not be considered a 
vector of attack. 
This data may also be leaked by getting recorded in a script, datum, or redeemer. E.g., a script 
may require that its redeemer also list the inputs of the transaction. The responsibility of mitigating 
this type of leakage rests on the SP, who can address this by limiting the kinds of specifications 
they agree to fulfill. 

\todobox{TODO : make sure we have shown that "We have demonstrated that guessing inputs 
without access to either the inputs themselves, or 
the transactions that have placed them into the UTxO set,
 is sufficiently difficult to not be considered a 
vector of attack."}

\section{Analysis}

\textbf{Asset and Non-Asset Compensation.} In our model, we have so far assumed that an SP performs its 
services in exchange for a fee. This fee may be either flat, or calculated on the basis of transaction size, 
or complexity of transaction specification, etc. - the details of this fee calculation are dependent on the 
specifics of the implementation of our protocol, the marketplace, and SPs preferences. 
The fee may also be specified in either an amount of primary tokens, 
or some other user-defined tokens. A fee requirement in user-defined tokens could be useful in the case 
of the SP service for LCs being associated with another type of service trading in such tokens, such as a 
videogame token marketplace. Yet another option for SPs is to request non-monetary compensation 
for their services, such as requiring engagement with a specific smart contract, voting for a specific update, 
delegating stake, etc. All these actions can be performed by the very transaction that SP constructed 
according to LC's specification.
